# learning_react
Just wanted to have a play with React and see what the fuss was about, starting by following a tutorial.

This follows the [Facebook React Tutorial for making a Tic Tac Toe game](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html)


### To D:
1. Display the move locations in the format "(1, 3)" instead of "6".
2. Bold the currently-selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
